ENCAPSULATION
Wrapping up the implementation of the data members and the methods  in a class
hides the code and data in a single unit to make it safe from access of outside world

ABSTRACTION
hiding unnecessary details and only showing necessary details

ex -> you have a key, you open the car turn on and move.
for driving a car you do not need to know how car is internally made and how they work together

ENCAPSULATION (engineer's work -> solves implementation stuff) VS ABSTRACTION (designer work) vauge example

how things should be and what parts must be visible to the user, or they need to know is selected by designers
while how we will achieve this is done via encapsulation



we achieve abstraction via ABSTRACT METHODS -> gaining information
encapsulation is done via getters and setter and do data hiding -> hides complexity of system
